# OpenAcornExplorer

OpenAcornExplorer is an open-source, cross-platform application for Acorn ADFS and DFS disc image manipulation.

## Motivation

There are currently no open-source applications suitable for reading and writing Acorn 8-bit and 32-bit disc images as used for both floppy and hard drive images.

OpenAcornExplorer aims to solve this by becoming a one-stop application for both DFS and ADFS image manipulation.  The project aims are:

Support for ADFS images:

* S  -  160K Single Density (BBC Micro and Master 128)
* M  -  320K Single Density (BBC Micro and Master 128)
* L  -  640K Single Density (BBC Micro, Master 128 and RISC OS 3.1)
* D  -  800K Double Density (RISC OS 3.1)
* E  -  800K Double Density (RISC OS 3.1)
* E+ -  800K Double Density (RISC OS 3.5)
* F  - 1600K Quad Density (RISC OS 3.5)
* F+ - 1600K Quad Density (RISC OS 3.5)

Support for DFS images:

* 40 Track single-sided
* 80 Track single-sided
* 80 Track double-sided

The project road-map is to support ADFS S, M and L initially, then D, E and F (including the + versions) and then, finally, DFS.

The application source code should be compatible with Windows, Linux and Mac (although Mac is a stretch-goal).

## Installation

It is not possible to install the application at this time.  This section will be updated as the project progresses.
